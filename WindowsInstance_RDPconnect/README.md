# Windows EC2 Instance Setup and RDP Connection

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to create a Windows EC2 instance on AWS and connect to it using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

## Steps

### 1. Create an EC2 Instance

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

2. **Launch an Instance:**
   - Click on `Launch Instance`.
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For this example, select `Microsoft Windows Server`.
   - Choose an Instance Type. For a simple setup, `t2.micro` is sufficient.

     - Add a rule for RDP (port 3389) to allow you to connect to the Windows instance.

3. **Launch and Connect:**
   - Review and launch the instance.
   - Download the key pair if prompted (if it's a new key pair).
   - Wait for the instance to start running.

### 2. Connect to the Instance

1. **Retrieve the Administrator Password:**
   - In the EC2 Console, select your instance.
   - Click on `Connect`, then `Get Password`.
   - Decrypt the password using the key pair you downloaded.

2. **Connect via RDP:**
   - Open your RDP client and enter the public DNS (IPv4) address of your instance.
   - Use the Administrator username and the decrypted password to connect.
   - If prompted, accept the certificate to establish the connection.
  
   ### Conclusion

You have successfully created a Windows EC2 instance on AWS and connected to it using RDP. You can now use this instance for various purposes like hosting applications, running scripts, or other tasks that require a Windows environment.
